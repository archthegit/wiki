## What is Janitor Monkey?

Janitor Monkey is a service which runs the cloud that looks for unused resources and cleans them up. It determines whether a resource should be a cleanup candidate by applying a set of rules on it. If any of the rules thinks that the resource is a cleanup candidate, Janitor Monkey marks the resource and schedules a time to terminate it. The service is configured to run, by default, on non-holiday weekdays at 11am. The schedule can be easily re-configured to fit your business's need.

## Why Run Janitor Monkey?

Cloud computing allows business to easily upscale their IT requirements when needed. New instances can be easily started for your services when you require more computing power. Volumes can also be easily created when you need more space to store your data. This flexibility is great for cloud users. However, good things do not come for free. You need to keep track of the resources you requested and remember to release them when they are no longer in use. Otherwise the unused resources will cost your monkey unnecessarily. This is not an easy task if your business owns thousands of resources. With Janitor Monkey manages your cloud resources, resources can be cleaned when they become unneeded. Just like garbage collection in programming languages frees software engineers from memory management in programming, Janitor Monkey allows engineers to focus on their applications in the cloud without being destracted by resource management.
