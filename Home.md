## What is Simian Army?

Simian Army consists of services (Monkeys) in the cloud for generating various kinds of failures, or detect abnormal conditions, and test our ability to survive them. The goal of it is to keep our cloud safe, secure, and highly available. More details can be found at [this blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html).

Currently the simians include [Chaos Monkey](wiki/Chaos-Home) and [Janitor Monkey](wiki/Janitor-Home).

Refer to the [Quick start guide](wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) to get started setting up and using the Monkeys.
